# Litecoin

Testnet on Bitcoin is having issues (hight fees), so I'm switching to testing LND with Litecoin.

LND supports two implementations of Litcoin full node: 
1. **litecoind**
2. **ltcd**

litecoind is the official implementation, yet
currently I'm using ltcd because litecoind has an issue: lightningnetwork/lnd#1854
